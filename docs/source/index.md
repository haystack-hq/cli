# Overview

HayStack allows developers to focus on the code and dev ops to focus on the stack. With HayStack, full stack environments can be spun up in seconds, on your local dev machine or in the cloud.

It is built on top of docker, so you get all the benifits of docker, but you also get fast local or cloud servers and automatic two way mounts directly into the docker containers, so your dev environments are fast!

* A student wants to spin up a dev environment quickly to work through a lesson.
* A company demoing software and would like their users to easily spin up a local version to test out.
* A softeare as a service company with an API or similar application and would like to provide quick no hassle environments for their users to try out the code. 
* An open source project that wants to eliminate road blocks for contributors. HayStack allows your contributors to get started contributing code in minutes, not days.
